# Java Dictionary Application

Welcome to Java Dictionary Application! This project is a simple yet effective implementation of a dictionary using Java. It offers basic functionalities such as adding, deleting, searching for words, and displaying the dictionary in different orders.

## Features

- **Add Word:** Easily add new words along with their meanings to the dictionary.
- **Delete Word:** Remove unwanted words from the dictionary.
- **Search Word:** Find the meaning of any word present in the dictionary.
- **Display Dictionary:** View the entire dictionary in pre-order, in-order, or post-order traversal.

## Concepts Covered

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** The dictionary is implemented using a binary search tree data structure. Each node of the tree holds a word and its corresponding meaning. This allows for efficient searching and insertion of words.

- **File Input/Output (I/O):** The application reads and writes data to a text file (`words.txt`) to persist the dictionary across sessions. This demonstrates file I/O operations in Java.

- **User Interface Handling:** The application provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the dictionary. Users can select options from the menu to perform various operations.
